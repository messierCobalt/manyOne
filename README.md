## ~~PLAY~~ READ ME:

Hello Zepp, I want you to make a choice. There's a slow-acting poison coursing through your system, which only I have the antidote for. Will you run these programs, to save yourself?

## ROADMAP:

Listen carefully if you will, there's a __*vision*__
### IMF/ (modules)
- [x] rachel.py (py txt styler)
- [x] hunt.py (CLI backbone)
- [ ] mooPoint.py (like a cowsay's opinion... it does matter)
### echoes/ (main programs)
- [x] CASE.py (case converter)
- [ ] nirvana.py (terminal clone---very simple)
- [ ] context.py (convert text---md <-> html, etc...)

## DON'T MAKE ME SAY:
> Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you, not anymore... **GAME OVER**!

## PIN-UP BOARD:
- I program these to sharpen my python skills.
- It's open source.
- You got any Trouble? file an issue, not to coppers.
- **And hey** don't forget to debug your own life!
